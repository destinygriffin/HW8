<h1>About Me</h1>
I usually go by Des and I'm from Chicago, IL. I attend the University of Iowa and I'm studying Business Analytics & Information Systems with a minor in African-American studies, I plan to graduate in December 2021.
I'm 21 years old, I'm engaged, and I currently have an internship at Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO). After graduation I plan to go to graduate school and get a double masters in Management Information Systems and Library Science.
I also plan to get a dog with my fiance so I can read my favorite books to them.

I currently hate everything so I'll ad more later thx
