<h1>About Destiny</h1>
<p>I usually go by Des and I'm from Chicago, IL. I attend the University of Iowa and I'm studying Business Analytics & Information Systems
<br> with a minor in African-American studies, I plan to graduate in December 2021. I'm 21 years old, I'm engaged, and I currently have
<br> an internship at Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO). After graduation I plan to go to graduate school and get a double masters in 
<br>Management Information Systems and Library Science. I also plan to get a dog with my fiance so I can read my favorite books to them.</p>
