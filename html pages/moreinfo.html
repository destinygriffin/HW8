<h1>More About Destiny</h1>
<p>I like to be outdoors, even though I'm afraid of bugs, and I love to have fun. Jack and I like to explore new hobbies and places together
<br>so we can make memories.He's majoring in Sports & Rec Management so there's never a dull moment between us. We plan on going hiking for 
<br> our honeymoon and taking lots of vacations together. I included a list of some of our favorite things to do:</p>
<p></p>

  <li>Church</li>
  <li>Mini Golf</li>
  <li>Hiking</li>
<li>Working Out</li>
</ul>
