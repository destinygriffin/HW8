<h1>More About Destiny</h1>
<p>I like to be outdoors, even though I'm afraid of bugs, and I love to have fun. Jack and I like to explore new hobbies and places together so we can make memories.
<br>He's majoring in Sports & Rec Management so there's never a dull moment between us. We plan on going hiking for our honeymoon and taking lots of vacations together.
